                "DIALOG_GARDEN_AREA_1_OBJECT_1_4": "Hmm, let me think…",
                "DIALOG_GARDEN_AREA_1_OBJECT_1_5": "That’s much better, it’s amazing how much some nice flowers can change to a garden.",

                "DIALOG_GARDEN_AREA_2_UNLOCK_7": "It’s not great, but nothing we can’t fix. What shall we pick up first?",

                "DIALOG_GARDEN_AREA_2_OBJECT_1_2": "WHAT??? You did not eat too much I hope... And what will you do with this van now?",
                "DIALOG_GARDEN_AREA_2_OBJECT_1_3": "I don’t know, but I can’t stop thinking about ice cream.",
                "DIALOG_GARDEN_AREA_2_OBJECT_1_4": "You really had ice cream on your mind, didn’t you?",
                "DIALOG_GARDEN_AREA_2_OBJECT_1_5": "Maybe I did eat too much...",
                "DIALOG_GARDEN_AREA_2_OBJECT_1_6": "You can pick up something unrelated to ice cream… like covering this dirt! My shoes are getting dirty...",

                "DIALOG_GARDEN_AREA_2_OBJECT_2_2": "Hmm, do I keep it natural, or make it fancy...",
                "DIALOG_GARDEN_AREA_2_OBJECT_2_3": "Nice choice! I like it.",
                "DIALOG_GARDEN_AREA_2_OBJECT_2_4": "And now back to ice cream! Maybe we can create some nice sitting spots.",
                "DIALOG_GARDEN_AREA_2_OBJECT_3_1": "Okay, let’s start with this first table.",
                "DIALOG_GARDEN_AREA_2_OBJECT_3_2": "I wonder what you’re going to do...",
                "DIALOG_GARDEN_AREA_2_OBJECT_3_3": "Ah! I see what you’re doing here.",
                "DIALOG_GARDEN_AREA_2_OBJECT_3_4": "Right? But there’s more to go.",
                "DIALOG_GARDEN_AREA_2_OBJECT_3_5": "Wow, how many people do you expect to visit your backyard?",
                "DIALOG_GARDEN_AREA_2_OBJECT_3_6": "What else should I do with all this space?",
                "DIALOG_GARDEN_AREA_2_OBJECT_3_7": "Well if you’re expecting visitors, we should tidy up these borders.",
                "DIALOG_GARDEN_AREA_2_OBJECT_4_1": "These bushes are not looking so lively these days.",
                "DIALOG_GARDEN_AREA_2_OBJECT_4_2": "I think we better replace these with new ones.",
                "DIALOG_GARDEN_AREA_2_OBJECT_4_3": "Good! And now to finish it up, let's top of this dirt.",
                "DIALOG_GARDEN_AREA_2_OBJECT_4_4": "Hmm I might need some help with that.",
                "DIALOG_GARDEN_AREA_2_OBJECT_5_1": "So Robert... Can you advise me on this task?",
                "DIALOG_GARDEN_AREA_2_OBJECT_5_2": "Of course! You can cover the soil with wood chips or pebbles so it is protected from the sun and stays hydrated better.",
                "DIALOG_GARDEN_AREA_2_OBJECT_5_3": "Ah right, I have seen some photos online of gardens using that.",
                "DIALOG_GARDEN_AREA_2_OBJECT_5_4": "I like it! And I added some lights as well.",
                "DIALOG_GARDEN_AREA_2_OBJECT_5_5": "Very nice, and now there’s only one task left.",
                "DIALOG_GARDEN_AREA_2_OBJECT_6_1": "Hey Lucy, what do you get when a cat sits on top of a pillar… A caterpillar!",
                "DIALOG_GARDEN_AREA_2_OBJECT_6_2": "...",
                "DIALOG_GARDEN_AREA_2_OBJECT_6_3": "And that was the final task! Outstanding job, Lucy!",
                "DIALOG_GARDEN_AREA_2_OBJECT_6_4": "Thanks! Couldn’t have done it without you.",
                "DIALOG_GARDEN_AREA_3_UNLOCK_1": "Oh you’re back! And I see you’ve brought a new flower!",
                "DIALOG_GARDEN_AREA_3_UNLOCK_2": "Isn’t it great? Does this mean we’ll unlock a new...",
                "DIALOG_GARDEN_AREA_3_UNLOCK_3": "WHAAAAA!",
                "DIALOG_GARDEN_AREA_3_UNLOCK_4": "I knew it was coming and it still scared me...",
                "DIALOG_GARDEN_AREA_3_UNLOCK_5": "Looks like I’ll be going to Jiggle Town... wait, is that jelly?",
                "DIALOG_GARDEN_AREA_3_UNLOCK_6": "Wow, look at those colours! And while we’re at it, let’s also start with the next area.",
                "DIALOG_GARDEN_AREA_3_UNLOCK_7": "Look at this! You’ve got a real courtyard behind your house!",
                "DIALOG_GARDEN_AREA_3_UNLOCK_8": "I don’t know if it honors that title the way it currently looks...",
                "DIALOG_GARDEN_AREA_3_UNLOCK_9": "It needs some work, but it has great potential!",
                "DIALOG_GARDEN_AREA_3_UNLOCK_10": "If I’ve learned anything, it is that we can make anything look great! Let’s start with the path this time.",
                "DIALOG_GARDEN_AREA_3_OBJECT_1_1": "Hey you’re back! So... was it really jelly?",
                "DIALOG_GARDEN_AREA_3_OBJECT_1_2": "The streets, buildings, trees, everything! EVEN THE PEOPLE!",
                "DIALOG_GARDEN_AREA_3_OBJECT_1_3": "How is that even possible… Anyways, did you get inspiration for the path?",
                "DIALOG_GARDEN_AREA_3_OBJECT_1_4": "Well… I can’t make stuff out of jelly here, but I’m feeling colourful!",
                "DIALOG_GARDEN_AREA_3_OBJECT_1_5": "Do you like it?",
                "DIALOG_GARDEN_AREA_3_OBJECT_1_6": "It’s great! Maybe you can accentuate it with some nice walls?",
                "DIALOG_GARDEN_AREA_3_OBJECT_2_1": "Ehmm, do you know how to lay bricks?",
                "DIALOG_GARDEN_AREA_3_OBJECT_2_2": "Well, I’m no mason, but I do have some experience...",
                "DIALOG_GARDEN_AREA_3_OBJECT_2_3": "Looks great! Thanks for the help.",
                "DIALOG_GARDEN_AREA_3_OBJECT_2_4": "No problemo! By the way...what is that thing in the middle, a flower bed?",
                "DIALOG_GARDEN_AREA_3_OBJECT_2_5": "I don’t know… but how about a fountain?",
                "DIALOG_GARDEN_AREA_3_OBJECT_3_1": "This will be great! I always wanted a fountain.",
                "DIALOG_GARDEN_AREA_3_OBJECT_3_2": "Ooooh that’s cool!",
                "DIALOG_GARDEN_AREA_3_OBJECT_3_3": "And now I want to do something organic again, my green fingers are tingling.",
                "DIALOG_GARDEN_AREA_3_OBJECT_4_1": "These bushes look like they deflated...",
                "DIALOG_GARDEN_AREA_3_OBJECT_4_2": "I don’t think that’s how bushes work...",
                "DIALOG_GARDEN_AREA_3_OBJECT_4_3": "So… one last bush to go?",
                "DIALOG_GARDEN_AREA_3_OBJECT_4_4": "Nope! I have different plans for that bush.",
                "DIALOG_GARDEN_AREA_3_OBJECT_4_5": "Oh? Exciting!",
                "DIALOG_GARDEN_AREA_3_OBJECT_5_1": "I wonder what it’ll be, I can’t wait!",
                "DIALOG_GARDEN_AREA_3_OBJECT_5_2": "Whoa... that’s terrific. I didn’t know you were an artist.",
                "DIALOG_GARDEN_AREA_3_OBJECT_5_3": "There’s much more to me that you don’t know… Speaking of art, it would be cool to place some here.",
                "DIALOG_GARDEN_AREA_3_OBJECT_6_1": "So… what kind of art are you going to place?",
                "DIALOG_GARDEN_AREA_3_OBJECT_6_2": "Sculptures of things I’ve been seeing a lot lately!",
                "DIALOG_GARDEN_AREA_3_OBJECT_6_3": "There you go! A bee, a ladybug, and a butterfly. My lovely friends in the garden.",
                "DIALOG_GARDEN_AREA_3_OBJECT_6_4": "Your friends need some flowers I suppose!",
                "DIALOG_GARDEN_AREA_3_OBJECT_7_1": "I’ve got the perfect flowers in mind...",
                "DIALOG_GARDEN_AREA_3_OBJECT_7_2": "Very cute… and now this area is done as well, at this pacing we’ll finish the whole garden in no time...",
                "DIALOG_GARDEN_AREA_3_OBJECT_7_3": "Your grandfather would be so proud!",
                "DIALOG_GARDEN_AREA_4_UNLOCK_1": "Nice flower! It looks… slimy.",
                "DIALOG_GARDEN_AREA_4_UNLOCK_2": "This time I’m ready for the book!",
                "DIALOG_GARDEN_AREA_4_UNLOCK_3": "...",

                "DIALOG_GARDEN_AREA_4_UNLOCK_5": "Hmmm, maybe you need to charge it?",
                "DIALOG_GARDEN_AREA_4_UNLOCK_6": "And how am I supposed to…",
                "DIALOG_GARDEN_AREA_4_UNLOCK_7": "WHAAAA!",
                "DIALOG_GARDEN_AREA_4_UNLOCK_8": "Wow, it’s a desert, how… exciting...",
                "DIALOG_GARDEN_AREA_4_UNLOCK_9": "Think of the flower, Lucy! And by the way, I think you might learn some useful things for this next area...",
                "DIALOG_GARDEN_AREA_4_UNLOCK_10": "Oh the beach! I remember going here when I was small! You know, I’m actually really good at building sandcastles.",
                "DIALOG_GARDEN_AREA_4_UNLOCK_11": "You’ll have to prove that first!",
                "DIALOG_GARDEN_AREA_4_UNLOCK_12": "you will see! But no time to waste, let’s start!",
                "DIALOG_GARDEN_AREA_4_OBJECT_1_1": "Ah! It's nice to work on the beach. My toes in the water, a breeze in my hair...",
                "DIALOG_GARDEN_AREA_4_OBJECT_1_2": "Sand in my mouth...",
                "DIALOG_GARDEN_AREA_4_OBJECT_1_3": "How charming...",
                "DIALOG_GARDEN_AREA_4_OBJECT_1_4": "Lovely path! I'll try to stay on it, the sand isn't safe for me.",

                "DIALOG_GARDEN_AREA_4_OBJECT_2_1": "So what's the plan here?",
                "DIALOG_GARDEN_AREA_4_OBJECT_2_2": "Hmm my grandfather used to have a little storage box, but I have bigger plans.",
                "DIALOG_GARDEN_AREA_4_OBJECT_2_3": "Wow, it's almost bigger than my house!",
                "DIALOG_GARDEN_AREA_4_OBJECT_2_4": "Nahhh, your house is nice! And it's good that you don't have a garden, or you wouldn't have time for me!",
                "DIALOG_GARDEN_AREA_4_OBJECT_2_5": "That's right! So let's plants some greens around this place.",
                "DIALOG_GARDEN_AREA_4_OBJECT_3_1": "We could place some exotic plants in this area! Maybe some palm trees?",
                "DIALOG_GARDEN_AREA_4_OBJECT_3_2": "Good idea! We could also add cactuses.",
                "DIALOG_GARDEN_AREA_4_OBJECT_3_3": "Alright but I once fell on one and it hurt! So, watch out.",
                "DIALOG_GARDEN_AREA_4_OBJECT_3_4": "Why am I not surprised…",
                "DIALOG_GARDEN_AREA_4_OBJECT_3_5": "Wow! This area is already starting to look really good.",
                "DIALOG_GARDEN_AREA_4_OBJECT_3_6": "It sure is! But we should start cleaning more immediately. I think we should clean up those old plastic chairs before they end up in the water!",
                "DIALOG_GARDEN_AREA_4_OBJECT_3_7": "Let’s do it! We can also create new places to sit while we’re at it!",
                "DIALOG_GARDEN_AREA_4_OBJECT_4_1": "This is a tough choice… Do we want a sitting area or some towels for sunbathing?",
                "DIALOG_GARDEN_AREA_4_OBJECT_4_2": "Totally up to you! However, let’s try not to use anything plastic this time!",
                "DIALOG_GARDEN_AREA_4_OBJECT_4_3": "Alright! This is what I call relaxing…",
                "DIALOG_GARDEN_AREA_4_OBJECT_4_4": "No time to relax now, let’s move on to the next task. I think we should clean up the rest of the beach first!",
                "DIALOG_GARDEN_AREA_4_OBJECT_4_5": "Yeah, you’re right. The warmth of the sun was making me lazy! Oh well, at least I don’t have to put sunscreen on my back anymore. That’s always such a hassle.",
                "DIALOG_GARDEN_AREA_4_OBJECT_4_6": "Lucky for you that I’m here!",
                "DIALOG_GARDEN_AREA_4_OBJECT_4_7": "No, you were right! We don’t have the time. Let’s get cleaning!",
                "DIALOG_GARDEN_AREA_4_OBJECT_4_8": "Oh well…",
                "DIALOG_GARDEN_AREA_4_OBJECT_5_1": "This mess is worse than I had thought!",

                "DIALOG_GARDEN_AREA_4_OBJECT_5_4": "This is awesome! This work is making me hungry though…",
                "DIALOG_GARDEN_AREA_4_OBJECT_5_5": "Oh! I know what’s best to eat at the beach!",
                "DIALOG_GARDEN_AREA_4_OBJECT_5_6": "Really? Tell me!",
                "DIALOG_GARDEN_AREA_4_OBJECT_5_7": "A sandwich of course!",

                "DIALOG_GARDEN_AREA_4_OBJECT_6_2": "Are you going to keep making jokes like this?",
                "DIALOG_GARDEN_AREA_4_OBJECT_6_3": "I may have a couple more up my sleeve… But I’ll keep it down for a bit!",

                "DIALOG_GARDEN_AREA_6_OBJECT_3_1": "Now we can make a wish in that well! Here I’ve got a coin for you too.",

                "DIALOG_GARDEN_AREA_6_OBJECT_6_3": "You’re right, let’s start with that small island in the corner!",
                "DIALOG_GARDEN_AREA_6_OBJECT_6_4": "Oh no! There is no bridge to that one... I’ll take my shoes and socks off this time!",
                "DIALOG_GARDEN_AREA_6_OBJECT_6_5": "I think we’re all done! No wait, this one has some broken branches…",
                "DIALOG_GARDEN_AREA_6_OBJECT_6_6": "Let me fix that! Did you know I once took a bush to the doctor?",
                "DIALOG_GARDEN_AREA_6_OBJECT_6_7": "No, I didn't, why would you?",
                "DIALOG_GARDEN_AREA_6_OBJECT_6_8": "Because it was feeling green!!",

                "DIALOG_GARDEN_AREA_7_UNLOCK_2": "It’s just the magic flower, I swear!",
                "DIALOG_GARDEN_AREA_7_UNLOCK_3": "Alright then… It does look nice though.",
                "DIALOG_GARDEN_AREA_7_UNLOCK_4": "Are those islands… floating?",
                "DIALOG_GARDEN_AREA_7_UNLOCK_5": "It doesn’t even surprise me anymore…",

                "DIALOG_GARDEN_AREA_7_OBJECT_2_1": "Look, Lucy! This boat is definitely fixable!",
                "DIALOG_GARDEN_AREA_7_OBJECT_2_2": "Watch out! You don’t want to fall into the water, AGAIN. Let’s add some fences, shall we?",
                "DIALOG_GARDEN_AREA_7_OBJECT_2_3": "That’s it! The fences are done... I think I did pretty well!!",
                "DIALOG_GARDEN_AREA_7_OBJECT_2_4": "Yeah! You totally nailed it!!",
                "DIALOG_GARDEN_AREA_7_OBJECT_2_5": "Oh you, always with those jokes…",
                "DIALOG_GARDEN_AREA_7_OBJECT_3_1": "What do you think we should do with this path?",

                "DIALOG_GARDEN_AREA_7_OBJECT_3_3": "Oh, I love herring! Let’s get some of that later!",
                "DIALOG_GARDEN_AREA_7_OBJECT_3_4": "I’ve never had that before, but I’ll try it with you!",
                "DIALOG_GARDEN_AREA_7_OBJECT_3_5": "This looks awesome!",

                "DIALOG_GARDEN_AREA_7_OBJECT_6_5": "Well, drinking can also be fun you know!",
                "DIALOG_GARDEN_AREA_7_OBJECT_7_1": "I wonder, what kind of drink should be served here?",

                "DIALOG_GARDEN_AREA_8_OBJECT_7_5": "Yeah! Let’s go!",
                "DIALOG_GARDEN_AREA_8_OBJECT_7_6": "Wait! Not in your overalls of course… Shouldn’t you get your bikini now?",
                "DIALOG_GARDEN_AREA_8_OBJECT_7_7": "Shoot! I really thought you had let me off the hook for that one!",
                "DIALOG_GARDEN_AREA_9_UNLOCK_1": "A coral flower? You know you’re not supposed to take coral as a souvenir, right?",
                "DIALOG_GARDEN_AREA_9_UNLOCK_2": "I think this is an exception, they gave it to me!",

                "DIALOG_GARDEN_AREA_9_UNLOCK_4": "A beehive! The bees have been so helpful in my gardens, maybe I can thank them in person.",

                "DIALOG_GARDEN_AREA_9_UNLOCK_8": "A flower field of course! I’m so excited!",
                "DIALOG_GARDEN_AREA_9_OBJECT_1_1": "Let’s start planting some flowers so the bees will move to this area!",
                "DIALOG_GARDEN_AREA_9_OBJECT_1_2": "Hmm, how about we start with the basics for this area first. We don’t want to damage the flowers while carrying materials around!",
                "DIALOG_GARDEN_AREA_9_OBJECT_1_3": "That’s true! We also don’t want to disturb the bees. How about the path first then?",

                "DIALOG_GARDEN_AREA_9_OBJECT_2_2": "Well, not really but let’s play around with some different sizes and shades of green!",

                "DIALOG_GARDEN_AREA_9_OBJECT_3_2": "He used it to grow seedlings, I think.",
                "DIALOG_GARDEN_AREA_9_OBJECT_3_3": "That makes sense! We should do that as well. We can grow the flowers here until they are ready to go into the garden.",

                "DIALOG_GARDEN_AREA_9_OBJECT_3_5": "Yes! Now we can grow some flowers in here while we make the rest of the area ready for the flowers.",
                "DIALOG_GARDEN_AREA_9_OBJECT_3_6": "Sounds like a plan. Let’s add some trees next!",
                "DIALOG_GARDEN_AREA_9_OBJECT_4_1": "Thanks to you for teaching me so much about gardening I can place some of these trees myself!",
                "DIALOG_GARDEN_AREA_9_OBJECT_4_2": "No problem, Lucy! Did you know that trees themselves learn as well?",
                "DIALOG_GARDEN_AREA_9_OBJECT_4_3": "Oh really? How do they do that?",
                "DIALOG_GARDEN_AREA_9_OBJECT_4_4": "They go to elementree school of course!",
                "DIALOG_GARDEN_AREA_9_OBJECT_4_5": "This looks great! You’ve gotten a lot stronger Lucy. You dragged those trees all the way from your home to this far end of the garden!",
                "DIALOG_GARDEN_AREA_9_OBJECT_4_6": "Yes, I did! And now I’m absolutely drained!",
                "DIALOG_GARDEN_AREA_9_OBJECT_4_7": "That I can believe! Allow me to rebuild that windmill for you, just tell me what you want.",
                "DIALOG_GARDEN_AREA_9_OBJECT_5_1": "So, for this windmill, do you want to go classic Dutch, modern, or something unique?",
                "DIALOG_GARDEN_AREA_9_OBJECT_5_2": "Let me see what I can come up with!",
                "DIALOG_GARDEN_AREA_9_OBJECT_5_3": "Wow! You did an amazing job, Robert!",
                "DIALOG_GARDEN_AREA_9_OBJECT_5_4": "Thank you! I’m proud of this build for sure! Also, great choice from you of course.",
                "DIALOG_GARDEN_AREA_9_OBJECT_5_5": "Thanks! I’ve gathered my strength and am ready to tackle the next task!!",
                "DIALOG_GARDEN_AREA_9_OBJECT_5_6": "That’s good because we’ve got a lot of flowers to plant!",
                "DIALOG_GARDEN_AREA_9_OBJECT_5_7": "Yay, I’m so excited!",
                "DIALOG_GARDEN_AREA_9_OBJECT_6_1": "Seems like the flowers were placed in rows here, what kind of flowers are planted like this though?",
                "DIALOG_GARDEN_AREA_9_OBJECT_6_2": "Tulips, I think?",
                "DIALOG_GARDEN_AREA_9_OBJECT_6_3": "Yes! That was it. Let’s plant some tulips!!",
                "DIALOG_GARDEN_AREA_9_OBJECT_6_4": "Outstanding job picking the colours!",
                "DIALOG_GARDEN_AREA_9_OBJECT_6_5": "Yes, this is gorgeous! Come over here, take a picture with me!",
                "DIALOG_GARDEN_AREA_9_OBJECT_6_6": "Oh! Alright! *Click* You look great in this one Lucy!",
                "DIALOG_GARDEN_AREA_9_OBJECT_6_7": "Thanks! Let’s build a home for the beeeeeeeeeess!! They will love these flowers!",
                "DIALOG_GARDEN_AREA_9_OBJECT_7_1": "Ooh my head is exploding with cute ideas for homes to build for our little bee friends!",
                "DIALOG_GARDEN_AREA_9_OBJECT_7_2": "I’m sure it is! Why don’t you make a top three and then we’ll pick the best one together.",
                "DIALOG_GARDEN_AREA_9_OBJECT_7_3": "This is amazing! And look!! They are already making honey… Let’s try some… *slurp*",
                "DIALOG_GARDEN_AREA_9_OBJECT_7_4": "Delicious!! But, somehow they make better honey in the Honey Hives!",
                "DIALOG_GARDEN_AREA_9_OBJECT_7_5": "I can believe that! By the way, this area is turning out great! But if you could add one thing, what would it be?",
                "DIALOG_GARDEN_AREA_9_OBJECT_7_6": "Well, I think this is a nice area for a tea party! So, let’s create a nice spot to have one!",
                "DIALOG_GARDEN_AREA_9_OBJECT_8_1": "Over there in the corner seems like a good spot!",
                "DIALOG_GARDEN_AREA_9_OBJECT_8_2": "I was thinking the exact same! Let’s do it!",
                "DIALOG_GARDEN_AREA_9_OBJECT_8_3": "This looks quite dandy. You’ve done an exquisite job, my lady.",

                "DIALOG_GARDEN_AREA_10_UNLOCK_2": "Aren’t you the one who always says that I shouldn’t take stuff from the other worlds.",
                "DIALOG_GARDEN_AREA_10_UNLOCK_3": "True… I’ll get my own honey with the bees we have now.",
                "DIALOG_GARDEN_AREA_10_UNLOCK_4": "Oh no, a volcano! That’s too dangerous! You can’t go!",
                "DIALOG_GARDEN_AREA_10_UNLOCK_5": "I have to! I’ve come too far to return now...",
                "DIALOG_GARDEN_AREA_10_UNLOCK_6": "I guess, if you have to...",

                "DIALOG_GARDEN_AREA_10_OBJECT_1_2": "Sounds like a plan. Let’s freshen up these paths and the grass as well!",
                "DIALOG_GARDEN_AREA_10_OBJECT_1_3": "Wow! This area has cleaned up nicely already!",
                "DIALOG_GARDEN_AREA_10_OBJECT_1_4": "It really did! We’ve become quite the professionals!",
                "DIALOG_GARDEN_AREA_10_OBJECT_1_5": "Yes, we have! By the way, don’t you think this area would be great to visit at night? We should add some lights along the paths.",

                "DIALOG_GARDEN_AREA_10_OBJECT_2_4": "Me too! Now we won’t trip on anything when we visit at night.",
                "DIALOG_GARDEN_AREA_10_OBJECT_2_5": "You know what else is great to do at night? Eating marshmallows at a campfire, let’s build one!",
                "DIALOG_GARDEN_AREA_10_OBJECT_3_1": "I loved your idea to build a campfire. But that’s mostly because of the marshmallows! It’s been so long since I had one!!!",

                "DIALOG_GARDEN_AREA_10_OBJECT_4_3": "Ooh it was nothing, really… Let’s replace these dead bushes immediately. It was on the to-do list anyway!",
                "DIALOG_GARDEN_AREA_10_OBJECT_4_4": "Alright, this looks good!",
                "DIALOG_GARDEN_AREA_10_OBJECT_4_5": "Yes! Really happy with this. By the way, do you also think it is getting colder by the day?",
                "DIALOG_GARDEN_AREA_10_OBJECT_4_6": "I haven’t really noticed... Maybe it’s because you spend so much time in the Fiery Fields!",
